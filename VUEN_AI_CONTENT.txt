COPY - ENGLISH
--------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. HERO SECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hero Eyebrow (small text above headline):
"You're making big decisions with tools that stall."

Main Headline:
"Stop wasting meetings waiting for dashboards."

Subheadline:
"You walk into a call with hard questions on revenue, churn, ops, and nobody can answer fast enough. Someone opens Power BI, someone else digs in Excel, everyone waits.
Vuen turns you into the person who asks a question out loud and gets the answer on screen in seconds - chart, explanation, and next step."

Inside the Orb Text:
- Line 1: "VISUAL DATA AGENT"
- Line 2: "TALK TO YOUR DATA"

CTA Primary: "Book a live demo"
CTA Secondary: "Watch 90-second overview"

Microcopy (under CTAs):
"Built for leaders who are done babysitting dashboards."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PROBLEM SECTION - "THIS IS YOUR REALITY"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"If this sounds like you, your BI is failing you."

Short Intro:
"You're not short on tools. You're short on answers when it matters - in front of your team, your investors, your customers."

Bullets:

1. "You ask a simple question and the room dies."
   "Give me a second, let me find the dashboard... what's the filter again?"

2. "You pay for Power BI/Tableau/Looker, but 90% of the company never logs in."
   "They take screenshots, export to PowerPoint, or 'follow up in an email.'"

3. "Follow-up questions kill momentum."
   "'And what about by region? By channel? Last year?' - 10 more clicks, 0 conviction."

4. "Only a couple of analysts know how to drive the tools."
   "Everyone else nods along, half blind."

5. "Latency makes you look weak."
   "Waiting 2-5 seconds every time you click feels like the tool is thinking harder than your team."

Punchline:
"You don't have a data problem. You have a 'cannot answer on the spot' problem."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. ASPIRATION SECTION - "WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"You don't want more dashboards. You want control in the room."

Short Copy:
"You want to walk into any meeting, ask 'How's X doing?' and have the answer appear on the screen while you're still talking - so you can drive the conversation, not wait on someone's mouse."

3 Bullets:

1. "Ask hard questions without warning."
   "Revenue, churn, cohorts, bottlenecks - live, not in a report three days later."

2. "Drill down without losing the room."
   "'Show this by region... now by product... now last year's comp' - no clicks, no chaos."

3. "Make everyone feel the numbers."
   "Charts, flows, maps, not another paragraph of AI text."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. SOLUTION SECTION - "WHAT VUEN ACTUALLY IS"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"Vuen is your Visual Data Agent."

One-Liner:
"You talk to a 3D orb, and it does the one thing none of your BI tools can: it keeps up with you."

3 Short Pillars:

1. Voice-First
   "You speak like a human. No SQL, no search bar, no training videos."

2. Instant Visualization
   "While everyone else is still opening a dashboard, you already have a live chart, map, or flow on the screen."

3. Verbal Explanation
   "The AI tells you what changed, why it matters, and offers the next question before anyone can say 'let me check.'"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EXPERIENCE SECTION - "HOW YOUR NEXT MEETING LOOKS"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"Your next revenue review, with a Visual Agent."

Left Side - The Movie:

User Says:
"How's revenue this quarter?"

What Happens:
- A line chart flashes onto the screen: $2.4M, up 15% vs last quarter.
- December glows at $850K, clearly the peak.
- A transcript panel shows:
  "Revenue hit $2.4M this quarter, up 15%.
  December was strongest at $850K.
  Source: Q4_Report.xlsx.
  Want this by region or forecast?"

Then User Says:
"Break it down by region."

- The chart morphs into a bar chart by region.
- The Visual Agent calls out: "North is leading with $1.2M. West is lagging at $320K."

Right Side - The Punchline:
"You look like the only person in the room who came prepared - even though you didn't touch a single dashboard."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SPEED SECTION - "WHY IT DOESN'T LAG"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"Everyone else waits on data. You don't."

Short Intro:
"Other tools wait for the AI to ask for data, then go hunting. That's why you stare at spinners. Vuen cheats."

4 Simple Steps:

1. "You finish talking."
   "Vuen detects it instantly."

2. "It starts pulling your data before the AI even decides what to say."
   "Your documents, exports, and tables are already warm."

3. "The AI chooses the right visual."
   "It calls the chart/map/flow tool using data that's already in memory."

4. "The answer appears as soon as the sentence starts."
   "You get visuals in under a second, not after everyone has checked their phones."

Closer Line:
"This is the difference between 'we'll follow up' and 'let's decide right now.'"

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. VISUALIZATION SECTION - "WHAT YOU CAN SEE"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"Everything you normally beg a dashboard for - on demand."

Short Intro:
"You keep your existing data. Vuen turns it into the visuals you need mid-conversation."

Bullets Grouped by Job:

To see if you're on track:
"KPI cards, bullet charts, and tables that show targets vs actuals in one glance."

To see what changed:
"Line, bar, and area charts for 'vs last quarter', 'vs last year', 'vs plan'."

To see how it's distributed:
"Histograms and scatter plots for risk, spread, and relationships."

To see where things are flowing or stuck:
"Sankey diagrams, heatmaps, and maps for funnels, budgets, supply chains, and regions."

Tagline:
"You don't pick chart types. You ask questions. Vuen picks the visual that makes the answer obvious."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. PERSISTENCE SECTION - "DASHBOARDS THAT FOLLOW YOU"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"You don't 'build dashboards.' You save the good moments."

Short Copy:
"Every time Vuen shows something useful, you hit Keep. That's it. No configuration hell."

Bullets:

1. One-click save
   "You're in the middle of a discussion, you see a powerful view, you tap Keep. Done."

2. A library of real moments
   "Your dashboards are just the best answers you've seen, organized in a simple grid."

3. Smart labels
   "Numbers show up as $45K, $1.2M, 42.3%, 5.3M - clean, readable, and scaled for real humans, not analysts squinting at raw values."

Punchline:
"Your 'BI stack' becomes a set of live scenes you can reopen at any time - not a graveyard of half-finished dashboards."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. WHO IT'S FOR - "MAKE THE CLIENT THE HERO"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"If this is you, Vuen makes you dangerous (in a good way)."

Tiles (second-person, hero framing):

Founder / CEO:
"You're tired of staring at static decks. With Vuen, you walk into your board or investor meeting and drive the conversation live, with real numbers reacting to your questions."

COO / Ops Leader:
"You run daily or weekly war rooms. Instead of flipping through dashboards, you ask 'Where are we leaking orders today?' and watch the problem areas light up on the map."

CFO / Head of Finance:
"You live in Excel. Vuen lets you talk to those files directly: 'Show me margin by product vs last year' - chart, explanation, and follow-up questions, no manual pivoting."

Head of Data / BI:
"You're the bottleneck for every 'quick question.' Vuen lets the rest of the org self-serve by voice, so your team can stop building one-off dashboards and focus on real models."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. UNDER THE HOOD - "TRUST WITHOUT BULLSHIT"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"This isn't a slide. It's a running product."

Short Bullets:
- "Built on FastAPI, Vite, WebGL (Three.js), and OpenAI Realtime - already serving live traffic."
- "Your files are isolated per tenant in their own storage and vector stores. No cross-contamination."
- "Every upload, query, and visualization runs through a quota system so the platform stays fast and predictable instead of collapsing when people actually use it."

One Line:
"You're not betting on a prototype. You're plugging into an engine that's already alive."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. EARLY ACCESS / PRICING - "INVITE ONLY, WITH TEETH"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"We only work with teams who are serious about using this."

Intro:
"We're not selling another seat of dashboard software. We're partnering with a small number of teams who want a Visual Agent that actually runs their conversations."

Card 1 - Launch your Visual Agent:
Price: "From $3.5K one-time"
Description: "We map your top 2-3 workflows, wire your files and exports into Vuen, and launch a working Visual Data Agent in 4-6 weeks."

Card 2 - Keep your Agent alive:
Price: "From $200/month"
Description: "Your team keeps using Vuen every day. We keep tuning it, adding workflows, and keeping it fast."

CTA Primary: "Apply for early access"
CTA Secondary (smaller): "Not sure yet? Book a 20-minute sanity check"

Microcopy:
"We say no if we don't think we can make you look noticeably sharper in your meetings."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. WAITLIST FORM MICROCOPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. "What do you wish you could do live in a meeting that you can't do now?"

4. "If Vuen worked perfectly, what would be the first 'holy shit' moment for you and your team?"

After Submit:
"You're in the queue. If your use case is a strong fit, we'll reach out with next steps. If not, we won't waste your time."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. FOUNDER SECTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section Title:
"Built by someone who's sick of slow tools wasting strong leaders."

Body:
"I'm Abdel Enoc Silva Escobar. I run ultramarathons for fun and build products for people who move fast. After watching smart teams paralyzed by dashboards and 'AI insights' that arrive after the meeting, I decided to build the tool I wanted you to have: a Visual Agent that makes you the sharpest person in the room, every time."
